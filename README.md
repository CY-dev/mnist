This is a demo to show you how to run a handwritten digit recognition model on [ClusterOne](https://clusterone.com). The demo uses [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) and the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.



Follow the instructions below to run the model on ClusterOne using the just command line interface. For an in-depth tutorial based on this repository, check out the [ClusterOne documentation](https://docs.clusterone.com/v1.0/docs/mnist-with-clusterone).

## Install

To run this project on the ClusterOne platform, you need:

- [Python](https://python.org/) 3.5 or higher
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- The ClusterOne Python library. Install it with `pip install clusterone`
- A ClusterOne account. [Sign up](https://clusterone.com/) for free if you don't have an account yet.

### Setting Up

Start out by cloning this repository onto your local machine. 

That's it! You're all set to run MNIST on ClusterOne.

## Usage

These instructions use the `just` command line tool. It comes with the ClusterOne Python library and is installed automatically with the library.

Start by opening a command line and logging into your ClusterOne account using `just login`.

First, create a new project on ClusterOne:

```shell
$ just create project --name mnist
```

Then, upload the code to the new project:

```shell
$ git push clusterone master
```

Finally, create a job and run it. Make sure to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your username.

```shell
$ just run --project <YOUR_USERNAME>/mnist --module mnist --name first-job \
--description first-job --worker-replicas 2 --worker-type c4.2xlarge \
--ps-replicas 1 --ps-type c4.2xlarge --time-limit 1h
```

The job will start automatically. You can monitor its progress on the command line using `just pulse`. More elaborate monitoring is available on the [Matrix](https://clusterone.com/matrix), ClusterOne's graphical web interface.

## More Info

For further information on this example, take a look at the tutorial based on this repository in the [ClusterOne Documentation](https://docs.clusterone.com/v1.0/docs/mnist-with-clusterone).

For further info on the MNIST dataset, check out [Yann LeCun's page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) about it. To learn more about TensorFlow and Deep Learning in general, take a look at the [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) website.
